# Prediction_by_random_forests
Application of random forests algorithm 

The objective is to predict whether a certain physical activity was carried out correctly or not. A large quantity of accelerometer data collected during barbell lifts by 6 participants (done correctly and incorrectly) was machine learned by random forests algorithm to build the prediction model.
